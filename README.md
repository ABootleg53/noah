## Usage

Start **noah** by executing `forever start --pidFile ~/noah/noah.pid -c bash ~/noah/noah.sh` in your terminal.

This will guarantee that the script will run forever which means even if it crashes it will be automatically restarted.

Run `ps ax | grep '/home/ark/noah/noah.sh' && ps ax | grep '~/noah/noah.sh'` and make sure there are only 2 processes related to the `noah.sh`.
